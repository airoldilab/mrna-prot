abstract = {There is a great interest in reliable ways to obtain absolute protein abundances at a proteome-wide scale. To this end, label-free LC-MS/MS quantification methods have been proposed where all identified proteins are assigned an estimated abundance. Several variants of this quantification approach have been presented, based on either the number of spectral counts per protein or MS1 peak intensities. Equipped with several datasets representing real biological environments, containing a high number of accurately quantified reference proteins, we evaluate five popular low-cost and easily implemented quantification methods (Absolute Protein Expression, Exponentially Modified Protein Abundance Index, Intensity-Based Absolute Quantification Index, Top3, and MeanInt). Our results demonstrate considerably improved abundance estimates upon implementing accurately quantified reference proteins; that is, using spiked in stable isotope labeled standard peptides or a standard protein mix, to generate a properly calibrated quantification model. We show that only the Top3 method is directly proportional to protein abundance over the full quantification range and is the preferred method in the absence of reference protein measurements. Additionally, we demonstrate that spectral count based quantification methods are associated with higher errors than MS1 peak intensity based methods. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of miscleaved, modified, and shared peptides as well as protein size and the number of employed reference proteins on quantification accuracy.},

abstract = {Ribosome profiling and high-throughput sequencing provide unprecedented opportunities for the analysis of mRNA translation. Using this novel method, several studies have demonstrated the widespread role of short upstream reading frames in translational control as well as slower elongation at the beginning of open reading frames in response to stress. Based on the initial studies, the importance of adding or omitting translation inhibitors, such as cycloheximide, was noted as it markedly affected ribosome coverage profiles. For that reason, many recent studies omitted translation inhibitors in the culture medium. Here, we investigate the influence of ranging cycloheximide concentrations on ribosome profiles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and demonstrate that increasing the drug concentration can overcome some of the artifacts. We subjected cells to various manipulations and show that neither oxidative stress nor heat shock nor amino acid starvation affect translation elongation. Instead, the observations in the initial studies are the result of cycloheximide-inflicted artifacts. Likewise, we find little support for short upstream reading frames to be involved in widespread protein synthesis regulation under stress conditions. Our study highlights the need for better standardization of ribosome profiling methods.},

@article{Huang2013,
abstract = {The advent of high throughput RNA-seq technology allows deep sampling of the transcriptome, making it possible to characterize both the diversity and the abundance of transcript isoforms. Accurate abundance estimation or transcript quantification of isoforms is critical for downstream differential analysis (e.g., healthy vs. diseased cells) but remains a challenging problem for several reasons. First, while various types of algorithms have been developed for abundance estimation, short reads often do not uniquely identify the transcript isoforms from which they were sampled. As a result, the quantification problem may not be identifiable, i.e., lacks a unique transcript solution even if the read maps uniquely to the reference genome. In this article, we develop a general linear model for transcript quantification that leverages reads spanning multiple splice junctions to ameliorate identifiability. Second, RNA-seq reads sampled from the transcriptome exhibit unknown position-specific and sequence-specific biases. We extend our method to simultaneously learn bias parameters during transcript quantification to improve accuracy. Third, transcript quantification is often provided with a candidate set of isoforms, not all of which are likely to be significantly expressed in a given tissue type or condition. By resolving the linear system with LASSO, our approach can infer an accurate set of dominantly expressed transcripts while existing methods tend to assign positive expression to every candidate isoform. Using simulated RNA-seq datasets, our method demonstrated better quantification accuracy and the inference of dominant set of transcripts than existing methods. The application of our method on real data experimentally demonstrated that transcript quantification is effective for differential analysis of transcriptomes.},

Ribosome profiling has already enabled highly reproducible measurements of translational control. Because this technique reports on the exact position of ribosomes, it also revealed the presence of ribosomes on upstream open reading frames and demonstrated that ribosome density was higher near the beginning of protein-coding genes. Here, we describe nuclease digestion conditions that produce uniform \~{}28 nucleotide (nt) protected fragments of mRNA templates that indicate the exact position of translating ribosomes. We also give a protocol for converting these RNA fragments into a DNA library that can be sequenced using the Illumina Genome Analyzer. Unbiased conversion of anonymous, small RNAs into a sequencing library is challenging, and we discuss standards that played a key role in optimizing library generation. Finally, we discuss how deep sequencing data can be used to quantify gene expression at the level of translation.},

   during cellular proliferation and quiescence. This rich resource
   provides the first comprehensive reference for all RNA and most protein
   concentrations in a eukaryote under two key physiological conditions.
   The integrated data set supports quantitative biology and affords unique
   insights into cell regulation. Although mRNAs are typically expressed in
   a narrow range above 1 copy/cell, most long, noncoding RNAs, except for
   a distinct subset, are tightly repressed below 1 copy/cell.
   Cell-cycle-regulated transcription tunes mRNA numbers to phase-specific
   requirements but can also bring about more switch-like expression.
   Proteins greatly exceed mRNAs in abundance and dynamic range, and
   concentrations are regulated to functional demands. Upon transition to
   quiescence, the proteome changes substantially, but, in stark contrast
   to mRNAs, proteins do not uniformly decrease but scale with cell volume.}},

@article{McManus2014,
abstract = {Understanding the patterns and causes of phenotypic divergence is a central goal in evolutionary biology. Much work has shown that mRNA abundance is highly variable between closely related species. However, the extent and mechanisms of post-transcriptional gene regulatory evolution are largely unknown. Here we used ribosome profiling to compare transcript abundance and translation efficiency in two closely related yeast species (S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus). By comparing translation regulatory divergence to interspecies differences in mRNA sequence features, we show that differences in transcript leaders and codon bias substantially contribute to divergent translation. Globally, we find that translation regulatory divergence often buffers species differences in mRNA abundance, such that ribosome occupancy is more conserved than transcript abundance. We used allele-specific ribosome profiling in interspecies hybrids to compare the relative contributions of cis- and trans-regulatory divergence to species differences in mRNA abundance and translation efficiency. The mode of gene regulatory divergence differs for these processes, as trans-regulatory changes play a greater role in divergent mRNA abundance than in divergent translation efficiency. Strikingly, most genes with aberrant transcript abundance in F1 hybrids (either over- or underexpressed compared to both parent species) did not exhibit aberrant ribosome occupancy. Our results show that interspecies differences in translation contribute substantially to the evolution of gene expression. Compensatory differences in transcript abundance and translation efficiency may increase the robustness of gene regulation.},

We combine measurements of protein production and degradation and mRNA dynamics so as to build a quantitative genomic model of the differential regulation of gene expression in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mouse dendritic cells. Changes in mRNA abundance play a dominant role in determining most dynamic fold changes in protein levels. Conversely, the preexisting proteome of proteins performing basic cellular functions is remodeled primarily through changes in protein production or degradation, accounting for more than half of the absolute change in protein molecules in the cell. Thus, the proteome is regulated by transcriptional induction for newly activated cellular functions and by protein life-cycle changes for remodeling of preexisting functions.},

abstract = {Much recent work has explored molecular and population-genetic constraints on the rate of protein sequence evolution. The best predictor of evolutionary rate is expression level, for reasons that have remained unexplained. Here, we hypothesize that selection to reduce the burden of protein misfolding will favor protein sequences with increased robustness to translational missense errors. Pressure for translational robustness increases with expression level and constrains sequence evolution. Using several sequenced yeast genomes, global expression and protein abundance data, and sets of paralogs traceable to an ancient whole-genome duplication in yeast, we rule out several confounding effects and show that expression level explains roughly half the variation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein evolutionary rates. We examine causes for expressionﾒs dominant role and find that genome-wide tests favor the translational robustness explanation over existing hypotheses that invoke constraints on function or translational efficiency. Our results suggest that proteins evolve at rates largely unrelated to their functions and can explain why highly expressed proteins evolve slowly across the tree of life.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Techniques for measuring protein abundance are rapidly advancing and we are now in a situation where we anticipate many protein abundance data sets will be available in the near future. Since proteins are translated from mRNAs, their expression is expected to be related to their abundance, to some degree.

RESULTS: We have developed a web tool, called PARE (Protein Abundance and mRNA Expression; http://proteomics.gersteinlab.org), to correlate these two quantities. In addition to globally comparing the quantities of protein and mRNA, PARE allows users to select subsets of proteins for focused study (based on functional categories and complexes). Furthermore, it highlights correlation outliers, which are potentially worth further examination.

CONCLUSION: We anticipate PARE will facilitate comparative studies on mRNA and protein abundance by the proteomics community.},

abstract = {Transcription, mRNA decay, translation and protein degradation are essential processes during eukaryotic gene expression, but their relative global contributions to steady-state protein concentrations in multi-cellular eukaryotes are largely unknown. Using measurements of absolute protein and mRNA abundances in cellular lysate from the human Daoy medulloblastoma cell line, we quantitatively evaluate the impact of mRNA concentration and sequence features implicated in translation and protein degradation on protein expression. Sequence features related to translation and protein degradation have an impact similar to that of mRNA abundance, and their combined contribution explains two-thirds of protein abundance variation. mRNA sequence lengths, amino-acid properties, upstream open reading frames and secondary structures in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) were the strongest individual correlates of protein concentrations. In a combined model, characteristics of the coding region and the 3'UTR explained a larger proportion of protein abundance variation than characteristics of the 5'UTR. The absolute protein and mRNA concentration measurements for >1000 human genes described here represent one of the largest datasets currently available, and reveal both general trends and specific examples of post-transcriptional regulation.},

abstract = {Based on large-scale data for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (protein and mRNA abundance, translational status, transcript length), we investigate the relation of transcription, translation, and protein turnover on a genome-wide scale. We elucidate variations between different spatial cell compartments and functional modules by comparing protein-to-mRNA ratios, translational activity, and a novel descriptor for protein-specific degradation (protein half-life descriptor). This analysis helps to understand the cell's strategy to use transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation mechanisms for managing protein levels. For instance, it is possible to identify modules that are subject to suppressed translation under normal conditions ("translation on demand"). In order to reduce inconsistencies between the datasets, we compiled a new reference mRNA abundance dataset and we present a novel approach to correct large microarray signals for a saturation bias. Accounting for ribosome density based on transcript length rather than ORF length improves the correlation of observed protein levels to translational activity. We discuss potential causes for the deviations of these correlations. Finally, we introduce a quantitative descriptor for protein degradation (protein half-life descriptor) and compare it to measured half-lives. The study demonstrates significant post-transcriptional control of protein levels for a number of different compartments and functional modules, which is missed when exclusively focusing on transcript levels.},

abstract = {Correlation between mRNA and protein expression is typically modest due to substantial posttranscriptional regulation. Using large-scale transcriptomic and proteomic data of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we quantitatively examined the effects of several posttranscriptional biological properties on the correlation between mRNA and protein expression levels (mRNA-protein correlation) on a genomewide scale. The two classes of properties investigated are (1) stability of mRNA and protein molecules and (2) biological properties related to translational process, such as codon usage and amino acid usage, and experimental data of ribosome density and occupancy. The multiple regression analysis showed that while mRNA half-life and translation initiation efficiency (estimated as mRNA secondary structure in the 5'-UTR) do not appear to have remarkable contributions to the variations in the mRNA-protein correlation, protein half-life descriptor (PHD) is identified as the most important property affecting mRNA-protein correlation (contributing to 16.87\% of the total variation in mRNA-protein correlation), suggesting protein degradation significantly affects mRNA-protein correlation. Codon usage and amino acid composition contribute to 8.89\% and 7.60\% of the total variation, respectively, which is consistent with several previous studies in bacteria (such as Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Desulfovibrio vulgaris), suggesting that mRNA-protein correlation is affected the most by elongation during protein translation. Taken together, all posttranscriptional biological properties contributed to 33.15\% of the total variation of mRNA-protein correlation.},

abstract = {Parallel profiling of mRNA and protein on a global scale and integrative analysis of these two data types could provide additional insights into the metabolic mechanisms underlying complex biological systems. However, because mRNA and protein abundance are affected by many cellular and physical processes, there have been conflicting results on their correlation. Using whole-genome microarray and LC-MS/MS proteomic data collected from Desulfovibrio vulgaris grown under three different conditions, we systematically investigate the relationship between mRNA and protein abundance by a multiple regression approach, in which some of the key covariates that may affect mRNA-protein relationship were included. The results showed that mRNA abundance alone can explain only 20-28\% of the total variation of protein abundance, suggesting mRNA-protein correlation can not be determined by mRNA abundance alone. Among various covariates, analytic variation of protein abundance is the major source for the variation of mRNA-protein correlation, which contributes to 34-44\% of the total variation of mRNA-protein correlation. The cellular functional category of genes/proteins contributes 10-15\% of the total variation of mRNA-protein correlation, with a more pronounced correlation of the two properties was observed for "central intermediary metabolism" and "energy metabolism" categories. In addition, protein stability also contributes 5\% of the total variation of mRNA-protein correlation. The study presents the first quantitative analysis of the contributions of various biochemical and physical sources to the correlation of mRNA and protein abundance in D. vulgaris.},

Using a shotgun proteomics approach based on multidimensional prefractionation and tandem mass spectrometry, we have detected approximately 30\% of the theoretical fission yeast proteome. Applying statistical modelling to normalize spectral counts to the number of predicted tryptic peptides, we have performed label-free quantification of 1465 proteins. The fission yeast protein data showed considerable correlations with mRNA levels and with the abundance of orthologous proteins in budding yeast. Functional pathway analysis indicated that the mRNA-protein correlation is strong for proteins involved in signalling and metabolic processes, but increasingly discordant for components of protein complexes, which clustered in groups with similar mRNA-protein ratios. Self-organizing map clustering of large-scale protein and mRNA data from fission and budding yeast revealed coordinate but not always concordant expression of components of functional pathways and protein complexes. This finding reaffirms at the protein level the considerable divergence in gene expression patterns of the two model organisms that was noticed in previous transcriptomic studies.},

abstract = {A key goal in molecular evolution is to extract mechanistic insights from signatures of selection. A case study is codon usage, where despite many recent advances and hypotheses, two longstanding problems remain: the relative contribution of selection and mutation in determining codon frequencies and the relative contribution of translational speed and accuracy to selection. The relevant targets of selection--the rate of translation and of mistranslation of a codon per unit time in the cell--can only be related to mechanistic properties of the translational apparatus if the number of transcripts per cell is known, requiring use of gene expression measurements. Perhaps surprisingly, different gene-expression data sets yield markedly different estimates of selection. We show that this is largely due to measurement noise, notably due to differences between studies rather than instrument error or biological variability. We develop an analytical framework that explicitly models noise in expression in the context of the population-genetic model. Estimates of mutation and selection strength in budding yeast produced by this method are robust to the expression data set used and are substantially higher than estimates using a noise-blind approach. We introduce per-gene selection estimates that correlate well with previous scoring systems, such as the codon adaptation index, while now carrying an evolutionary interpretation. On average, selection for codon usage in budding yeast is weak, yet our estimates show that genes range from virtually unselected to average per-codon selection coefficients above the inverse population size. Our analytical framework may be generally useful for distinguishing biological signals from measurement noise in other applications that depend upon measurements of gene expression.},

We could not detect significant protein turnover in either fast-or slow-growing cultures, so the lower ribosome efficiency does not seem to be an artifact caused by changes in unstable protein production at different growth rates. Nor is the lower ribosome efficiency due to slower migration of ribosomes along mRNA: the times required to complete polypeptides of known molecular weights are the same in slow-growing cells as those previously determined for fast-growing cells [Waldron, Jund \& Lacroute (1974) FEBS Lett. 46, 11-16]. We therefore deduce that ribosome efficiency changes in yeast because the fraction of ribosomes engaged in protein synthesis falls (from 84\% in fast-growing cells to 50\% in slow-growing cells.},

Here, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome sequence, DNA microarray expression data, tRNA gene numbers, and functional categorizations of proteins are employed to determine whether the amino acid composition of peptides reflects natural selection to optimize the speed and accuracy of translation. Strong relationships between synonymous codon usage bias and estimates of transcript abundance suggest that DNA array data serve as adequate predictors of translation rates. Amino acid usage also shows striking relationships with expression levels. Stronger correlations between tRNA concentrations and amino acid abundances among highly expressed proteins than among less abundant proteins support adaptation of both tRNA abundances and amino acid usage to enhance the speed and accuracy of protein synthesis. Natural selection for efficient synthesis appears to also favor shorter proteins as a function of their expression levels. Comparisons restricted to proteins within functional classes are employed to control for differences in amino acid composition and protein size that reflect differences in the functional requirements of proteins expressed at different levels.},

Poly(A)-tail lengths were conserved between orthologous mRNAs, with mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins and other 'housekeeping' proteins tending to have shorter tails. As expected, tail lengths were coupled to translational efficiencies in early zebrafish and frog embryos. However, this strong coupling diminished at gastrulation and was absent in non-embryonic samples, indicating a rapid developmental switch in the nature of translational control. This switch complements an earlier switch to zygotic transcriptional control and explains why the predominant effect of microRNA-mediated deadenylation concurrently shifts from translational repression to mRNA destabilization.},

abstract = {Understanding the patterns and causes of phenotypic divergence is a central goal in evolutionary biology. Much work has shown that mRNA abundance is highly variable between closely related species. However, the extent and mechanisms of post-transcriptional gene regulatory evolution are largely unknown. Here we used ribosome profiling to compare transcript abundance and translation efficiency in two closely related yeast species (S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus). By comparing translation regulatory divergence to interspecies differences in mRNA sequence features, we show that differences in transcript leaders and codon bias substantially contribute to divergent translation. Globally, we find that translation regulatory divergence often buffers species differences in mRNA abundance, such that ribosome occupancy is more conserved than transcript abundance. We used allele-specific ribosome profiling in interspecies hybrids to compare the relative contributions of cis- and trans-regulatory divergence to species differences in mRNA abundance and translation efficiency. The mode of gene regulatory divergence differs for these processes, as trans-regulatory changes play a greater role in divergent mRNA abundance than in divergent translation efficiency. Strikingly, most genes with aberrant transcript abundance in F1 hybrids (either over- or underexpressed compared to both parent species) did not exhibit aberrant ribosome occupancy. Our results show that interspecies differences in translation contribute substantially to the evolution of gene expression. Compensatory differences in transcript abundance and translation efficiency may increase the robustness of gene regulation.},
