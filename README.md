### Abstract

Cells respond to their environment by modulating protein levels
through mRNA transcription and post-transcriptional control. Modest observed
correlations between global steady-state mRNA and protein measurements
have been interpreted as evidence that mRNA levels determine
roughly 40% of the variation in protein levels, indicating dominant
post-transcriptional effects. However, the techniques underlying these
conclusions, such as correlation and regression, yield biased results
when data are noisy, missing systematically, and collinear---properties
of mRNA and protein measurements---which motivated us to revisit this
subject. Noise-robust analyses of 24 studies of budding yeast reveal
that mRNA levels explain more than 85% of the variation in steady-state
protein levels. Protein levels are not proportional to mRNA levels, but rise much more rapidly. Regulation of translation suffices to explain this nonlinear effect, revealing post-transcriptional amplification of, rather than competition with, transcriptional signals. These results substantially revise widely credited models of protein-level regulation, and introduce multiple noise-aware approaches essential for proper analysis of many biological phenomena.
